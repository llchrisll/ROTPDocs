#Contribution
You are free to help me with any kind of translation/work.  
Finding typos, mistranslations or even making me notice that there are missing items in the project itself.  
I welcome everything (less work for me).  
Be sure to post it in the Discord in the #feedback channel.

I have made and uploaded a video to help you visually:

## Text Editor Settings
Most files here, including itemInfo.lua, were edited by using [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  
If you're interested in translating, the default settings of NPP aren't suited for editing itemInfo.lua,  
because there are 4 type of fonts that came from 4 main official servers (kRO, jRO, twRO and iRO) that could break items' resource names.

Thus, you need to set up your NPP to:  
1. Open Tab **Settings** > **Preferences** > **New Document**, then change **Encoding** to ANSI  
2. Open Tab **Settings** > **Preferences** > **MISC.**, then DESELECT **Autodetect character encoding**

That way, when you open itemInfo.lua for the first time, it should look like this:

Other things, like choice of font or style, are up to you.

## Translation Layout
In case you still want to participate and got your Notepad++ or similar ready to go.  
I would like to ask you to pretty much follow the format by downloading the [translation_layout.txt](../downloads/translation_layout.txt){:download="translation_layout.txt"}.

If you have suggestions regarding the colorization, you can do that.
