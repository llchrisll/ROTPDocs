This project supports from 2015 till the latest clients (I hope at least).
Currently I tested the following clients with the required adjustments:
(see "Client Support" folder and especially the "Project Guide" page)

Note: I'm not sure if I missed any feature which comes with a certain client,
because at the time I tested it I looked for the Digital Space Robe and High item ID Support.
