kRO doesn't have these Enchantment Prefixes like jRO has, so I made it optionally via seperate [folder](https://github.com/llchrisll/ROenglishRE/tree/master/Addons/jRO%20Enchants%20Display).  

In case you don't know what I mean with `Enchantment Prefixes`:  

 - Enchantments are like Cards, but for kRO they don't have any entries in these files, so they won't be recognized as such.  
 - jRO on the other hand, added Prefixes for them to show like `<Fighting Spirit7>` for ID 4822 in the Equipment Name, just like Cards.
