Welcome to the documentation for the Translation Project.  
Here you can find many useful guides for the client-side.  

Especially important is the guide to use this project, [Project Installation](https://llchrisll.github.io/ROTPDocs/guides/install/).  

You can also find guides unrelated to the project, like adding Custom Items and many more.
