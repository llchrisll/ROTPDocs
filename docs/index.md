![](images/ROTPbySapito_mask.png)
[ROenglishRE](https://rathena.org/board/topic/102689-ragnarok-english-translation-project/) is an unofficial english translation (Fan translation) project for Korea Ragnarok Online Renewal that focused on translating items, skills and textures, while it also includes items from other official servers like jRO.  
This project also supports pre-renewal by overwriting the content of the Renewal folder with the Pre-Renewal one.  

The priority of item translation goes like this:  
1. kRO  
2. jRO  
3. iRO  
4. bRO  
5. idRO  
6. GGHRO  
7. twRO  
8. phRO and cRO if there is still something left
